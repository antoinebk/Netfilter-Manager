PURPOSE
#######

The purpose of this application is to manage the netfilter rules for a number of
remote hosts.

netfilter rules can be created by entering either classic iptables rules or by
entering Cisco firewall rules. This will be of convenience to those coming from
the Cisco world and having trouble adapting themselves to iptables syntax :-)

Rules are stored on the management node (most likely this host) until they are
"pushed" to the distant node.

FUNCTIONS
#########

Rule management :
  - via Cisco rules
  - via reguler iptables rules

Host management :
  - Manage hosts via their name and their DNS name or IP

Rules export :
  - Push rules via SSH
  - Once pushed, execute rules script directly if root or via sudo if non-root


USE
###

Help
¡¡¡¡¡¡¡

If you feel lost at any time, use the 'help' command which will give you extra
information.

You may also have to access top help for certain commands. This will be included
in the generic help for the mode you are currently in.


Exit
¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
If you wish to exit the program, you can enter "quit" at any time.

If you wish to exit the mode you are currently in, you can enter "exit" at any
time.

Mode Selection
¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡

First, you need to select the mode that you will be using. You can choose
between 4 modes :

    - add
    - del
    - push
    - show

The mode you are currently in will be shown at the prompt as shown below.

    ex : (add) >

    1. Add mode
    -----------

    The add mode will enable to you to add configuration information. There are
two types of information you can add : host-specific and non-host-specific.

    host-specific information needs you to select a host before you can add
information. You can do this by using the "select" command as show below. If you
do not select a host, the command will return an error asking you to select one.

    ex : (add) > select test-host-1

    Commands requiring host selection are the following :

    - access-list
    - iptables
    - line

    Commands that do not require host selection are the following :

    - exit
    - help
    - host
    - quit

    We will now detail the use of the commands available in the add mode.

    1. a) access-list command
    =========================

    This command is host-specific therefore requires host selection before it
can be used.

    This command allows you to add Cisco-style access lists to a host.
